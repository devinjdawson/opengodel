[![](../../assets/docs/fx/fx-01.png)](../../assets/docs/fx/fx-01.webm)

## How to use FX

**Command:**

FX

![Godel Terminal command bar showing FX typed with the COMMANDS autocomplete suggesting 'Compare and calculate forex pairs'](./FX Command (Forex Pairs) _ Godel Terminal Docs_files/fx-02.png)

## Converter Bar

At the top of the window:

* **Invert**: swaps the "from" and "to" currencies.
* **From currency**: select the currency of your input amount.
* **Amount**: number to convert (up to 1 quadrillion).
* **To currency**: target currency.
* **Result**: the converted amount, color-coded by the current day's change in the pair.

## Currency Matrix

Every supported currency is shown on both axes of a live matrix. Each cell is the exchange rate for column → row, color-shaded by the day's change (green for strengthening, red for weakening). Hovering a cell shows the pair label and exact rate.

Supported currencies:

| Code | Country |
| --- | --- |
| **USD** | United States |
| **EUR** | Eurozone |
| **JPY** | Japan |
| **GBP** | United Kingdom |
| **CHF** | Switzerland |
| **CAD** | Canada |
| **AUD** | Australia |
| **NZD** | New Zealand |
| **HKD** | Hong Kong |
| **NOK** | Norway |
| **SEK** | Sweden |
| **CNY** | China |
| **RUB** | Russia |
| **INR** | India |

Each row and column header displays the currency code next to its country flag.

## Rate Resolution

For each currency pair, FX picks the best available feed:

1. **Direct pair** (e.g. EURUSD): used as-is. 2. **Inverse pair** (e.g. if only USDEUR is available when EURUSD is requested): inverted automatically. 3. **Cross-rate**: if neither direct nor inverse is available, a cross is computed via the relevant USD legs.
