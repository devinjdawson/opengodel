TAS

# TAS: Time and Sales Command

TAS is the Godel Terminal command for streaming every individual trade for a security as it happens: price, size, venue, and condition code.

[![](../../assets/docs/tas/tas-01-poster.png)](../../assets/docs/tas/tas-01.webm)

## Aliases

TR is an alias for TAS: either shortcut opens the same Time and Sales window.

## How to use TAS

**Security Identifier/Ticker Country/Instrument Asset Class TAS**

Example: META US EQ TAS: live trade tape for Meta.

## Display Columns

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Ticker** | Security symbol |
| **Time** | Trade timestamp (millisecond precision available: see Settings) |
| **Price** | Execution price |
| **Size** | Share / contract count |
| **Market** | Market center / exchange where the trade printed (see reference below) |
| **Condition** | Trade condition code: hover for the plain-English meaning |

You can hide or reorder any column from the settings panel.

## Settings

Click the **gear icon** to open the settings panel:

* **Flash**: when on, each new row briefly flashes the primary theme color as it arrives, helping you track fast tapes.
* **Show Milliseconds**: include milliseconds in the timestamp column.
* **Columns**: check / uncheck Ticker, Time, Price, Size, Market, Condition.

## Trade Condition Codes

TAS decodes the standard US trade condition codes, including:

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **@** | Regular Sale |
| **F** | Intermarket Sweep |
| **I** | Odd Lot Trade |
| **O** | Opening Prints |
| **5** | Re-Opening Prints |
| **6** | Closing Prints |
| **4** | Derivatively Priced |
| **7** | Qualified Contingent Trade (QCT) |
| **W** | Average Price Trade |
| **X** | Cross / Periodic Auction Trade |
| **Z** | Sold (Out of Sequence) |
| **T** | Form T (Extended Hours) |

(Full list of over 30 codes decoded in-app.)

## Market Centers

The **Market** column decodes venue identifiers such as:

* **Q / T**: The NASDAQ Stock Market
* **N**: New York Stock Exchange
* **P**: NYSE Arca
* **Z**: BATS
* **K**: Cboe EDGX
* **J**: Cboe EDGA
* **Y**: Cboe BYX
* **U**: Members Exchange
* **L**: Nasdaq / FINRA TRF (Cartaret)
* **D**: FINRA Alternative Display Facility

Cryptocurrency tapes decode exchange IDs for **Coinbase**, **Binance**, **Kraken**, **Bitstamp**, and others.

## Notes

* TAS can be scoped to a single security (AAPL US EQ TAS) or opened globally (TAS) to view the tape of whatever you pivot to.
